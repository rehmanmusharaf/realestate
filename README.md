## Overview

The Real Estate Website is designed to facilitate property transactions through an efficient and user-friendly interface. It supports two primary roles: users and administrators. The platform enables users to create accounts, register properties for sale or rent, and interact directly with property owners. Administrators have enhanced control to monitor and manage the platform.

### Key Features

- **User Accounts**: Users can create accounts to list properties for sale or rent and, if they are buyers, search for properties to buy or rent.
- **Image Recognition**: Integration of TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library, ensures only valid and relevant property images are uploaded. This enhances the quality and accuracy of the property listings.
- **Direct Communication**: Buyers can directly interact with property owners for negotiations and deal finalizations, streamlining the process of buying or renting properties.
- **Listing Management**: Property owners can easily remove their listings once their properties are sold or rented.

## Technologies Used

- **MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
- **TensorFlow**: For image recognition and validation
